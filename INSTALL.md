## Sparky Install

1. Follow all of the stuff that was in the [README](https://github.com/BEASTSM96/Sparky-Engine/blob/master/README.md).                                                                            
  1.5 In the root folder (solution directory), go to [Spark/vendor/imgui](https://github.com/BEASTSM96/Sparky-Engine/tree/master/Spark/vendor), now make a new file call it `premake5.lua`.
  
  
2. In that file Copy [this](https://github.com/BEASTSM96/Sparky-Engine/blob/master/Spark/vendor/imgui.p5.premake5).  
  2.5 now Go to the [Gen-Projects.bat](https://github.com/BEASTSM96/Sparky-Engine/blob/master/scripts/WindowsGenProjects.bat).
