Sparky is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows. Currently not much is implemented.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2019 is recommended, Sparky is officially untested on other development environments whilst we focus on a Windows build.

### Main features to come:
- Fast 2D rendering (UI, particles, sprites, etc.)
- High-fidelity Physically-Based 3D rendering (this will be expanded later, 2D to come first)
- Support for Mac, Linux, Android and iOS
    - Native rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan, Metal)
